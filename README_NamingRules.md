Used when importing or creating ToolBit from code.

Alternates naming is to use:

- very simple default of Diameter-val_Shape-name
- specified text, which is fixed and must be set for each tool


- Note that rules must create a valid filename for the ToolBit. Also it is best if filename is valid on any of the three supported platforms, avoid using \/:*?"<>| and non-printable characters such as the ASCII control-characters. Also avoid spaces and graphic characters.
