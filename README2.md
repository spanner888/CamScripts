## About CamScripts

CamScripts provide powerful ways to automate many FreeCAD CAM tasks:

- Quickly import your tools database or supplier data to create FreeCAD Tools libraries, so you always have upto date Tools when creating CAM Jobs.
Save time by quickly entering and reviewing tabular data including Tool Flutes, Helix and Rake angles in CSV, rather than one by one in FreeCAD. Now you can have one definitive Tool data source!

- Very flexible naming rules can be used during import. There is also an autonumbering option.

- Create entire families of Tools in FreeCAD without importing data, using script to define, for example a Tool shape, material, Diameter or Flute count range. While testing I accidently created over 1,600 Tools in one run.

- Additional scripts show how to create & recreate every step of the FreeCAD CAM process.
This gives you powerful ways to create CAM Jobs and ensure that your standard settings for rapid feeds, and postprocessor details are consistently set, as well as ensuring the Sanity check report is run and gcode automaticaly created and saved. These scripts extend the excelent work that russ4262 and others have done over the last year.

- Demo of Speeds and Feeds calculations using the just released Machinability Materials, which uses the new Materials system. This showcases a very useful data set for common metals and wood/woodlike materials and also poses plenty of questions about how we can help with the next steps of this ongoing work.
